## Introduction

Digital Rain is a visual effect that mimics a stream of falling raindrops on a computer screen. The effect was first popularised by its use in "The Matrix" and has since been adopted in various contexts. It was originally depicted as layers of green Unicode characters with a white head that fade as they fell down the screen.

In this blog I will explore my approach to this challenge, my implementation using features of modern C++, and the problems I encountered along the way.


## Design & Test

### Project Structure
My project features three classes.

- The DigitalRain class is responsible for creating RainDrop objects, adding them to a vector, and calling the print method on each RainDrop. 

- A RainDrop object holds the data for each individual drop and will print them one character at a time when the DigitalRain class instructs it to do so.

- A StartMenu object is created when the project starts. I designed this class to add some customisation to my project. The user can select the set of characters and colour they wish to be printed.

### Design Challenges

#### Character Animation
Console output is typically written horizontally, whereas Digital Rain requires the output to be written vertically. The easiest option here was to use the WinAPI's ```SetConsoleCursorPosition``` method which allows me to set the X and Y coordinate of the cursor and print a character anywhere in the console window. In this case creating the falling animation is as simple as incrementing the Y coordinate each time a character is printed. 

#### Generating Random Characters
Digital Rain with random characters is much more interesting than a single character. I have used C++'s ```default_random_engine``` from the ```<random>``` library. ```default_random_engine``` is a modern C++ feature and is generally considered better than C's ```rand``` function due to its higher quality random number generation.

#### Performance Optimisation
The efficiency of the algorithm will determine how smooth the Digital Rain appears. My printing algorithm may need to loop through, and print 200 characters per "frame". Even a 500Î¼s delay when printing each character could result in a noticable performance drop. This was the biggest challenge I encountered and I will expand on the performance issues later in the problem solving section.

## Algorithm

### My Approach
I considered a number of approaches when I began planning this project. I could choose to use mulithreading, asynchronous tasks, or even treat the console window as a large 2D array. Instead I chose to focus on the core logic of the simulation without adding overhead such as thread coordination and synchronisation.

I have split my algorithm into two sections. My object management occurs in the outer loop and is responsible for managing my ```RainDrop``` objects. My printing algorithm is called on each ```RainDrop``` object at the end of the Object Management loop.

### Object Management

</div>

Each ```RainDrop``` object is intialised with a random ```length``` and ```X``` coordinate. 

I have designed my such that only three hundred raindrop object will exist at one time, this provides good character density while only increasing my process memory usage by 100KB.

My printing algorithm loops through and prints each character in a ```RainDrop```'s ```chars``` vector before incrementing the ```Y``` coordinate. I made the decision to add characters to the drop each loop to create a smooth falling effect as the drop enters the screen. When the drop reaches the bottom of the screen I begin to pop characters from the vector so it can exit the screen. 

I have excluded a set of ```if/else``` statements that determine the character's colour for simplicity.

## Performance

Performance was one of my main concerns while working on this project.
